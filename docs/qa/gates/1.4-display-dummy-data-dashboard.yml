  status: "BLOCKED"
  reason: "Critical test failures must be resolved"
  blockers:
    - "Fix App.test.tsx to match current implementation"
  recommendations:
    - "Update test expectations to reflect Dashboard functionality"
    - "Add dedicated Dashboard component tests"
    - "Verify CI/CD pipeline works after test fixes"

  summary: |
    Story 1.4 implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and functional requirements.
    The Dashboard properly displays dummy data with accurate calculations, correct Thai localization,
    and proper data joining. Code quality is high with strong TypeScript safety.
    
    However, deployment is BLOCKED due to failing unit tests that need updating to match the
    current implementation. Once test issues are resolved, this story is ready for production.

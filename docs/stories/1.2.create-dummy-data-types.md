# Story 1.2: Create Dummy Data & Types

## Status
Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to define TypeScript interfaces and create a dummy data file for orders,
**so that** the frontend has a clear and consistent data structure to build against.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. ‡∏°‡∏µ Type `Order`  
3. ‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏π‡∏• `dummyOrders` ‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏¢ 4-5 ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£
4. export ‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏ñ‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]
- npm Workspaces structure successfully created with `packages/shared-types/` directory
- TypeScript ~5.2.2 properly configured with path aliases
- Project structure follows Monorepo layout with proper workspace configuration
- All dependencies and build tools working correctly

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**Order Interface Requirements:**
```typescript
export interface Order {
  id: string; // UUID
  created_at: string;
  customer_name: string;
  destination: string;
  truck_id: string; // Foreign Key to Truck
  status: 'Pending' | 'In Transit' | 'Delivered' | 'Urgent';
}
```

**Truck Interface Requirements:**
```typescript
export interface Truck {
  id: string; // UUID
  plate_number: string;
  driver_name: string;
  // ‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏à‡∏∞‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏π‡∏•‡∏ï‡∏≥‡πÅ‡∏´‡∏ô‡πà‡∏á lat, lon ‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏ï
}
```

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **TypeScript Interfaces:** `/packages/shared-types/src/index.ts` (shared across workspaces)
- **Dummy Data:** `/apps/web/src/data/dummies.ts` (web app data files)
- **Package Export:** Ensure proper export from shared-types package.json
- **Import Path:** Use workspace reference `shared-types` for importing

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use TypeScript ~5.2.2 for type definitions
- Follow npm Workspaces structure for shared types
- Ensure compatibility with React ~18.2.0 imports

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Create simple unit tests to verify data structure integrity
- Test that dummy data matches TypeScript interface definitions
- Use Vitest for testing data validation
- Verify imports work correctly across workspace boundaries

## Testing
### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Framework:** Vitest for unit tests
- **Test Location:** Co-locate tests with data files or in `__tests__` directories
- **Testing Goal:** Ensure data structure integrity and proper TypeScript typing during MVP
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Verify dummyOrders array contains correct Order interface structure
  - Test that truck_id references exist in dummyTrucks
  - Validate all status values are from allowed enum
  - Confirm proper exports and imports across workspaces

## QA Results

### Pre-Implementation Review Date: 2025-08-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Story Quality Assessment

**Status Note**: This story is currently in "Draft" status. Typically, QA reviews occur after implementation when status is "Review". This is a pre-implementation quality assessment of the story specification.

### Specification Quality Analysis

**Strong Points:**
- ‚úÖ Clear, well-defined acceptance criteria with specific deliverables
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive task breakdown with proper AC traceability  
- ‚úÖ Excellent technical context from architecture documents
- ‚úÖ Proper integration with previous story (1.1) workspace setup
- ‚úÖ Detailed data model specifications match architecture requirements
- ‚úÖ Testing strategy clearly defined with specific validation requirements

### Requirements Traceability

**Given** a developer needs to create data structures for the logistics application  
**When** implementing TypeScript interfaces and dummy data  
**Then** all acceptance criteria should be verifiable:

- **AC 1 (dummies.ts file)**: ‚úì File location specified in `/apps/web/src/data/dummies.ts`
- **AC 2 (Order Type)**: ‚úì Complete interface definition provided from architecture
- **AC 3 (4-5 dummy orders)**: ‚úì Requirements for realistic Thai data specified  
- **AC 4 (proper exports)**: ‚úì Cross-workspace export/import strategy detailed

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Factors:**
- Well-established patterns (TypeScript interfaces, dummy data)
- Clear dependencies on completed Story 1.1 foundation
- No external integrations or complex business logic
- Straightforward file creation and data structure work

**Medium Risk Factors:**
- npm Workspaces cross-package imports (potential configuration issues)
- Data referential integrity (truck_id relationships)
- TypeScript path alias compatibility

**Risk Score**: 3/10 (Low Risk - straightforward implementation)

### Testing Strategy Validation

**Excellent Test Coverage Planned:**
- ‚úÖ Data structure integrity validation
- ‚úÖ TypeScript interface compliance testing
- ‚úÖ Cross-workspace import/export verification
- ‚úÖ Referential integrity checks (truck_id validation)
- ‚úÖ Vitest integration for unit testing

### NFR Assessment

**Security**: ‚úì PASS - No security concerns with dummy data creation  
**Performance**: ‚úì PASS - Minimal performance impact for static data  
**Reliability**: ‚úì PASS - Simple data structures with proper validation  
**Maintainability**: ‚úì PASS - Well-documented with clear file locations

### Recommendations for Implementation

**Immediate (Must Address):**
- Ensure proper UUID generation for realistic IDs
- Validate all truck_id references are consistent
- Test cross-workspace imports thoroughly

**Future Enhancements (Consider Later):**
- Add data validation utility functions
- Consider data factory pattern for test data generation
- Plan for future real API integration transition

### Pre-Implementation Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** ‚Üí docs/qa/gates/1.2-create-dummy-data-types.yml

**Quality Score**: 95/100

**Rationale**: Exceptionally well-prepared story with comprehensive technical context, clear requirements, and solid testing strategy. Ready for implementation with minimal risk.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Ready for Implementation** - Story specification is comprehensive
2. ‚úÖ **Proceed with Development** - All technical details provided
3. ‚è≥ **Post-Implementation Review** - Schedule QA review after dev completion
4. üìã **Update Status to "InProgress"** when development begins

**Note**: This pre-implementation assessment evaluates story quality. A full implementation review will occur once the story status changes to "Review" and development is complete.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]
- React project successfully initialized with TypeScript ~5.2.2 configuration
- shadcn/ui library installed and configured with Card, Table, and Button components
- Tailwind CSS ~3.4.1 properly integrated for styling
- Project follows Monorepo structure in `/apps/web/` directory
- Development server functional with hot reload capability

### UI Design Requirements
[Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md]
- **Overall UX Vision:** "ความเรียบง่ายและชัดเจน" (Simplicity and Clarity) - users must see the most important information immediately with minimal clicks
- **Key Interaction Paradigms:** Dashboard-centric interface with data grouped in "การ์ด" (cards) and "ตาราง" (tables) format
- **Core Screens:** Main Dashboard is the primary interface (this story)
- **Target Platforms:** Web Responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA standards compliance required

### Functional Requirements Context
[Source: prd/requirements.md]
- **FR1:** Dashboard must be the first page after login
- **FR2:** Must display "รายการรถที่ต้องจัดส่งวันนี้" section
- **FR3:** Must display "ออเดอร์ด่วนที่เข้ามาใหม่" section  
- **FR4:** Must display "สถานะรถที่กำลังเดินทาง" section
- **FR5:** Vehicle status must show: driver name, license plate, cargo, latest map location
- **NFR1:** Simple and convenient UI for non-technical users
- **NFR3:** Must use React and shadcn/ui for UI components

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Dashboard Page:** `/apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (main page component)
- **Components:** `/apps/web/src/components/` (if additional components needed)
- **UI Components:** Already available from shadcn/ui (Card, Table, Button)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use React ~18.2.0 with TypeScript ~5.2.2
- Use shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS ~3.4.1 for styling
- Follow responsive design principles for Web Responsive platform
- Ensure compatibility with Vite ~5.2.0 build system

### Component Architecture
- Use shadcn/ui Card component for the three dashboard cards
- Use shadcn/ui Table component for vehicle status display
- Apply Tailwind CSS classes for responsive layout and spacing
- Follow React component best practices with proper props and TypeScript types

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Create component tests using Vitest and React Testing Library
- Focus on Dashboard functionality and proper rendering
- Test responsive behavior and component structure
- Verify accessibility standards are met

## Testing
### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Framework:** Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component testing
- **Test Location:** Co-locate tests with components or in `__tests__` directories
- **Testing Goal:** Ensure Dashboard rendering and basic layout functionality during MVP
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Verify Dashboard component renders without errors
  - Test that all three cards are displayed with correct headers
  - Validate table structure with proper headers
  - Confirm responsive design works on different screen sizes
  - Check accessibility compliance (WCAG AA standards)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Story Quality Assessment

**Status Note**: This story is currently in "Draft" status. This is a pre-implementation quality assessment of the story specification, focusing on UI/UX requirements and testability.

### Specification Quality Analysis

**Outstanding Strengths:**
- ✅ **Clear Visual Requirements**: Specific UI elements defined (3 cards + table structure)
- ✅ **Bilingual Context**: Thai logistics terms with English translations for developer clarity
- ✅ **Accessibility Integration**: WCAG AA compliance explicitly required in tasks
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Multi-device testing requirements clearly specified
- ✅ **Architecture Alignment**: Perfect integration with shadcn/ui components from Story 1.1
- ✅ **Thai Business Context**: Authentic logistics terminology and workflow understanding

### Requirements Traceability

**Given** a user needs to understand the application structure  
**When** accessing the main dashboard interface  
**Then** all visual acceptance criteria should be verifiable:

- **AC 1 (Dashboard.tsx)**: ✓ File location `/apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` specified
- **AC 2 (แสดงหัวข้อ)**: ✓ Main heading/title implementation guidance provided
- **AC 3 (Card 3 ใบ)**: ✓ Three specific cards with Thai names and purposes defined
- **AC 4 (Table Headers)**: ✓ Complete table structure with Thai column headers specified

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Factors:**
- Well-established UI patterns (cards, tables, responsive layout)
- Clear dependency on completed Story 1.1 shadcn/ui setup
- Static layout implementation with no complex business logic
- Comprehensive technical context from architecture documents

**Medium Risk Factors:**
- Accessibility testing complexity (WCAG AA compliance validation)
- Responsive design across multiple device types
- Thai text rendering and display consistency
- Integration with routing system

**Risk Score**: 4/10 (Low-Medium Risk - primarily UI complexity)

### UI/UX Quality Validation

**Design Consistency:**
- ✅ **Simplicity & Clarity**: Aligns with core UX vision
- ✅ **Dashboard-Centric**: Matches interaction paradigm requirements
- ✅ **Card/Table Layout**: Follows specified organizational patterns

- Plan for error state handling in static components

### Architecture Integration Assessment

**Excellent Foundation Building:**
- ✅ **Story Sequence**: Perfect progression from 1.1 (setup) → 1.3 (layout) → 1.4 (data)
- ✅ **Component Reuse**: Leverages established shadcn/ui component library
- ✅ **File Organization**: Follows Monorepo structure requirements
- ✅ **Technical Stack**: Full alignment with React + TypeScript + Tailwind

### Pre-Implementation Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.3-build-static-dashboard-layout.yml

**Quality Score**: 92/100

**Rationale**: Exceptionally well-prepared UI story with comprehensive accessibility requirements, authentic Thai logistics context, and solid technical foundation. Minor complexity around responsive design and accessibility testing.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. ✅ **Ready for Implementation** - Story specification is comprehensive and well-structured
2. ✅ **Proceed with UI Development** - All component and layout details provided
3. 📱 **Prioritize Responsive Testing** - Multi-device validation is critical
4. ♿ **Focus on Accessibility** - WCAG AA compliance requires thorough testing
5. 🇹🇭 **Validate Thai Text Display** - Ensure proper localization rendering

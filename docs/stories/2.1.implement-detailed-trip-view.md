## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.4 Completion]
- Dashboard.tsx successfully displays vehicle status table with joined Order+Truck data
- Data filtering logic established for orders by status (In Transit, Pending, Urgent)
- Thai text rendering working correctly in table cells
- shadcn/ui Table and Card components fully integrated and functional

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**Order Interface Available:**
```typescript
export interface Order {
  id: string; // UUID
  created_at: string;
  customer_name: string;
  destination: string;
  truck_id: string; // Foreign Key to Truck
  status: 'Pending' | 'In Transit' | 'Delivered' | 'Urgent';
}
```

**Truck Interface Available:**
```typescript
export interface Truck {
  id: string; // UUID
  plate_number: string;
  driver_name: string;
  // อาจจะมีข้อมูลตำแหน่ง lat, lon ในอนาคต
}
```

- Must use React ~18.2.0 hooks and patterns
- Ensure compatibility with existing Vite ~5.2.0 build system
- Follow TypeScript ~5.2.2 strict typing requirements
- Maintain responsive design with Tailwind CSS ~3.4.1

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Framework**: Vitest and React Testing Library for component testing
- **Test Location**: Co-locate tests with TripDetailModal component
- **Testing Goals**: Ensure modal functionality and data display work correctly
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test modal open/close behavior
  - Verify correct data display for different order/truck combinations
  - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
  - Validate accessibility compliance (ARIA attributes)
  - Test keyboard navigation and ESC key handling

## Testing
### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Framework**: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component testing
- **Test Location**: `/apps/web/src/components/TripDetailModal.test.tsx`
- **Testing Goal**: Ensure modal component functionality and integration with Dashboard
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test modal renders with correct trip details
  - Verify modal opens when table row is clicked
  - Test modal closes with close button, ESC key, and click outside
  - Validate proper data formatting and Thai text display
  - Test responsive behavior and accessibility features

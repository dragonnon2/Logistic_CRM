- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui Button component already available from Story 1.1 setup
- **Test Location**: `/apps/web/src/components/TripDetailModal.test.tsx` (already exists)

### Technical Stack Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui (latest) - Button component available for consistent styling
- **Frontend Framework**: React ~18.2.0 - use React hooks for state management
- **Language**: TypeScript ~5.2.2 - ensure proper typing for button handlers
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4.1 - use for button spacing and responsive design
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library - extend existing test suite

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**Order Interface Available:**
```typescript
export interface Order {
  id: string; // UUID
  created_at: string;
  customer_name: string;
  destination: string;
  truck_id: string; // Foreign Key to Truck
  status: 'Pending' | 'In Transit' | 'Delivered' | 'Urgent';
}
```

**Truck Interface Available:**
```typescript
export interface Truck {
  id: string; // UUID
  plate_number: string;
  driver_name: string;
}
```

### File Locations and Integration Points
- **Target File**: `/apps/web/src/components/TripDetailModal.tsx` (modify existing)
- **Test File**: `/apps/web/src/components/TripDetailModal.test.tsx` (extend existing)
- **Dependencies**: shadcn/ui Button component, React hooks for handlers
- **Props Integration**: Use existing order and truck data for button context

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must maintain React ~18.2.0 patterns and TypeScript ~5.2.2 strict typing
- Follow existing shadcn/ui integration patterns established in Story 2.1
- Maintain bilingual Thai/English support for button labels
- Ensure responsive design with Tailwind CSS ~3.4.1 utilities

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Framework**: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component testing
- **Test Location**: `/apps/web/src/components/TripDetailModal.test.tsx` (extend existing file)
- **Testing Goal**: Ensure button functionality and integration work correctly during MVP
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test both action buttons render correctly in modal
  - Verify button click handlers are called when buttons are clicked
  - Test button accessibility attributes and ARIA compliance
  - Ensure buttons maintain proper styling and responsive behavior
  - Validate bilingual button text display (Thai/English)
  - Test integration with existing modal functionality

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION** - Story 2.2 demonstrates outstanding software engineering practices with production-ready quality. The implementation showcases:

- **Architectural Excellence**: Perfect integration with existing TripDetailModal component without disrupting established patterns
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with proper event handler typing
- **User Experience**: Intuitive button placement in modal footer with smart state management (Contact Driver disabled when no driver data)
- **Accessibility**: Full ARIA compliance with descriptive labels in Thai language for screen readers
- **Internationalization**: Maintains consistent Thai/English bilingual support established in previous stories
- **Testing Quality**: Comprehensive 15-test suite covering all scenarios including edge cases, disabled states, and accessibility

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary - the code quality already meets production standards. All architectural patterns, naming conventions, and coding practices align perfectly with project requirements established in Stories 1.1 and 2.1.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ Excellent adherence to React and TypeScript best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✅ Perfect alignment with monorepo structure and component organization  
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ Exemplary implementation with Vitest + React Testing Library following established patterns
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ Both acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested with comprehensive edge case coverage

### Improvements Checklist

All improvements were handled during implementation:

- [x] Responsive design implemented with mobile-first approach (w-full sm:w-auto classes)
- [x] Smart button state management (Contact Driver disabled when no truck data available)
- [x] Comprehensive accessibility with proper ARIA labels
- [x] Bilingual Thai/English support maintained
- [x] Extensive test coverage including disabled state testing
- [x] Proper TypeScript typing for all handlers and props
- [x] Integration with existing modal patterns without breaking changes

### Security Review

✅ **NO SECURITY CONCERNS IDENTIFIED**
- Button handlers use safe console.log and alert patterns for MVP placeholder functionality  
- No XSS vulnerabilities in dynamic content rendering
- Proper TypeScript typing prevents injection attacks
- Safe data access patterns with optional chaining for truck data

### Performance Considerations

✅ **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED**
- Efficient button rendering with proper React patterns
- Minimal re-render impact with local handler functions
- Lightweight placeholder functionality with no blocking operations
- No memory leaks in button state management

### Test Architecture Review

**COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE** - 15 tests providing excellent scenario coverage:

**Original Modal Tests (8 tests):** All continue to pass, ensuring no regression
**New Action Button Tests (7 tests):**
1. ✅ **Button Rendering**: Both action buttons display correctly in modal footer
2. ✅ **Contact Driver Handler**: Proper console.log and alert functionality with truck data
3. ✅ **Log Issue Handler**: Proper console.log and alert functionality with order data  
4. ✅ **Disabled State Logic**: Contact Driver button disabled when no truck data available
5. ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling when truck information is missing
6. ✅ **Accessibility Testing**: ARIA labels and screen reader support validated
7. ✅ **Responsive Layout**: Mobile and desktop button layout verification

**Test Quality**: Excellent use of mocking (console.log, window.alert), proper assertion patterns, and comprehensive edge case coverage including accessibility compliance.

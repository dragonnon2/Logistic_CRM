## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.3 Completion - QA Results]
- Project demonstrates excellent React TypeScript patterns and component structure
- Comprehensive testing strategy established with Vitest + React Testing Library
- Component files follow shadcn/ui patterns with proper accessibility
- Bilingual Thai/English interface established as project standard
- State management and responsive design patterns are well-established

### Authentication Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Authentication Backend**: Supabase Auth (latest) - although MVP will use mock authentication
- **State Management**: Zustand ~4.5.2 for authentication state
- **Frontend Framework**: React ~18.2.0 with proper hooks patterns
- **TypeScript**: ~5.2.2 with strict typing requirements
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS ~3.4.1 styling

### Data Models Context
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**Existing User Interface:**
```typescript
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: string;
}
```

**Proposed Authentication State Extension:**
```typescript
export interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

### Project Structure Context
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Login Page Location**: `/apps/web/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` (new file)
- **Authentication Hook**: `/apps/web/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` (new file)  
- **Authentication Store**: `/apps/web/src/lib/authStore.ts` (new file)
- **Main App Component**: `/apps/web/src/App.tsx` (modify existing)
- **Type Definitions**: `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts` (extend existing)

### Security Context
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]
- **Environment Variables**: Store any authentication keys in `.env` files
- **Row Level Security**: Future integration with Supabase RLS when moving from mock auth
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All authentication configuration must use environment variables

### API Integration Context  
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- **Mock Authentication**: For MVP phase, implement client-side mock authentication
- **Supabase Client**: Located in `/apps/web/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` for future integration
- **Future Integration**: Prepare structure for easy migration to real Supabase Auth

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must maintain React ~18.2.0 patterns and hooks compatibility
- Follow TypeScript ~5.2.2 strict typing with proper interface definitions
- Use Vite ~5.2.0 compatible imports and module structure
- Maintain shadcn/ui component patterns established in previous stories
- Preserve responsive design and accessibility standards

### Component Integration Strategy
- **Main App Flow**: App.tsx → check auth state → render LoginPage or Dashboard
- **Authentication Flow**: LoginPage → authStore.login() → redirect to Dashboard
- **State Persistence**: Use localStorage for MVP, prepare for Supabase session management
- **Route Protection**: Implement authentication guard for protected routes

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Framework**: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component testing
- **Test Location**: `/apps/web/src/pages/LoginPage.test.tsx` (new file)
- **Additional Tests**: `/apps/web/src/hooks/useAuth.test.ts` and `/apps/web/src/lib/authStore.test.ts`
- **Testing Goal**: Ensure authentication flow works correctly during MVP phase
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test form validation and input handling
  - Verify successful authentication redirects to Dashboard  
  - Test error display for failed authentication attempts
  - Validate responsive design and accessibility features
  - Test state persistence and restoration
  - Ensure integration with existing Dashboard component works correctly
  - Test route protection and navigation logic
